<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm a 22-year-old Bengali girl from a middle-class Indian family, currently pursuing my 3rd year in BTech in Electronics and Instrumentation Engineering. Though my academic background is core engineering, I've recently started exploring software and coding because I want to build a career in tech. I'm still a beginner, but I'm determined to learn and grow. I'm not afraid to start from scratch—I know I can do it with the right guidance and effort. I dream of getting a job that not only supports me financially but also gives me confidence and independence.</p>

<p>Health-wise, I’ve been managing PCOS and thyroid, which sometimes makes things challenging—but I never let it hold me back. I'm trying to lose 2–2.5 kg in a healthy, consistent way. I follow an intermittent fasting routine, eat simple Bengali meals with a balance of protein and carbs, and I’ve recently added 30 minutes of cardio and daily walks into my routine. I love fish more than chicken, enjoy traditional dishes like dal, rice, and khichuri, and I prefer cooked or diluted yogurt because I can't have it raw. I'm also into natural remedies like turmeric-amla and jeera/methi/dhaniya water.</p>

<p>Beyond academics and health, I'm someone who’s emotionally strong, grateful for small joys, and always willing to work hard for my goals. Whether it's getting an internship at AIIMS Kalyani or learning HTML on my laptop, I take initiative, ask questions, and try to keep improving. I may not have everything figured out, but I trust my journey. I believe that with discipline and belief in myself, I’ll create a life I can be proud of.
